# ðŸš€ CPP 

This is my first C++ repository and also my starting point on GitHub.  
It marks the beginning of my journey in both programming with C++ and using Git & GitHub for version control.

# ðŸ“˜ What's Inside?

This repository includes my very first C++ programs:
- welcome.cpp â†’ Simple welcome message to start the journey
- input1.cpp, input2.cpp, input3.cpp â†’ Practicing how to take user input using cin and display output with cout

# ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

# ðŸ§  C++ Learning:
- Understand basic syntax
- Practice simple input/output operations
- Learn to compile and run code

# ðŸ›  GitHub Learning:
- Create and push repositories
- Write commits and track changes
- Organize code using version control
- Write clear documentation (like this!)

# ðŸ“ˆ Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository as a personal milestone to:
- Start writing and uploading basic C++ code
- Learn how Git and GitHub work in real-time
- Build a consistent habit of pushing code and documenting my progress

This is not just about programs â€” it is about building discipline and structure in my coding journey.
THE CPP JOURNEY CONTINUE IN MY FOLLOWING REPO.
